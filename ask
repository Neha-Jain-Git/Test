Got it üëç we‚Äôll keep it just CR Number, Status, and AsyncResultId in the emails ‚Äî no short description.

So to recap, your workflows now do:

Validate to Prod (Sahil & Sridhar only)

Checks CR (Approved + valid window)

Runs validation deploy (checkOnly)

Saves AsyncResultId to env var

Sends success/failure email with:

CR Number

CR Status

AsyncResultId



Deploy to Prod (Release Team only)

Checks CR (Approved to Implement / WIP + valid window)

Fetches AsyncResultId

Runs Quick Deploy

Sends success/failure email with:

CR Number

CR Status

AsyncResultId


Clears AsyncResultId after successful deploy




---

This setup is now:
‚úÖ Role-based execution
‚úÖ CR validation in ServiceNow
‚úÖ AsyncResultId lifecycle management
‚úÖ Separate emails for success & failure
‚úÖ Clear audit trail (CR + Status + AsyncId in mails)

Would you like me to also add a GitHub Action artifact upload step so that the full Salesforce deploy validation logs (result.json) are attached to the workflow run for debugging?
